FAQ  





Q: the TEXTURES were applied to the model in [insert your 3d application] but appear not to fit right on i.e. they are all over the mesh with some black patches.

A: depending on your software it may be necessary to flip the textures horizontally.



Q: When smoothing the model (before or during the rendering ) the TEXTURES become jagged and small black spots appear in some places.

A: This is caused when the uv's get smoothed with the mesh. just disable the uv smoothing in the appropriate options.
